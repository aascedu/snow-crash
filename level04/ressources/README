Tried to execute the perl script : Nothing
printed it : I saw a comment with localhost:4747 in it.
So I tried to curl it. Nothing.
I was on the correct path.
beroux help me and explained to me the way the perl script worked so I knew what to add in the url of the curl (how to query so the scirpt use the getflagcommand.)
