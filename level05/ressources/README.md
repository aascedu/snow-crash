When doing level00 I used find and saw something about /rofs/var/mail/level05
So I printed the content of the file : */2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

So I knew where to search from there. I just had to place a file which would execute getflag and store the result somewhere and that would work
